pong

 for pong game i used the two paddles one for user control and the other for the computer paddle and the third sprite is the ball. the theory that this game has a computer paddle that move constantly and the user has the control for the other paddle and the ball shouldn't hit the paddle to gain one point in the score and if the ball hits one of the paddles the user lose one point
